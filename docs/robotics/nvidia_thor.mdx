## Basics

Make sure you have the following before installation:

- Device: 945-14070-0080-000 | Jetson AGX Thor Developer Kit
- USB Memory Stick 

Install the latest Dev Kit base image [following this guide]
(https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/agx-thor-devkit/user-guide/latest/quick_start.html). 

Helpful hint: If you are on a mac, you can quickly wipe the USB drive for use with Balena Etcher with these commands:

```bash
diskutil list
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 SANDISK /dev/disk2
```

We typically use the `Monitor-attached` flow. We have successfully used `jetsoninstaller-0.2.0-r38.2-2025-08-22-01-33-29-arm64.iso`. Sometimes the installation hangs right after `freeing initrd memory` at t = 4s, but just restart the Thor and try again; it should work eventually. You will be left with the Thor running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS. 

## JetPack SDK

Once you have installed Ubuntu, [install JetPack](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/agx-thor-devkit/user-guide/latest/setup_jetpack.html).

## System Basics

```bash
sudo apt install chromium-browser
```

You can run the usual Ubuntu software updater without hosing the install. 

## System Info

* **GPU**: You can get GPU stats and other basic information via the built in command `nvidia-smi`. The command should show CUDA version 13. 

* **tegastats**: The `tegrastats` command (via the top right corner Nvidia dropdown) gives you information about system temperatures, frequencies, and power consumption in a terminal. 

* **Jetson Power GUI** gives you a visual overview of CPU, GPU, Thermal, Power, and fans.  

## OM1

Then, install OM1 on the Nvidia Thor from its command line, following the [standard instructions](../developing/1_get-started.mdx).

## Robot Deployments

For robot deployments, we recommend modules such as the [Auvidea Jetson T5000 module](https://auvidea.eu/press-release-nvidia-jetson-thor-t5000-launch/) since it directly accepts 24V to 48V, unlike the dev kit 9â€“28V DC Micro-fit power connector.

## Done

You are now running OM1 on your Nvidia Thor. Explore its capabilities and refer to the [OM1 GitHub repository](https://github.com/openmind/OM1) for advanced settings and next steps.
