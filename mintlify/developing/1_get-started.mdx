## System Requirements

### Operating System

- Linux (Ubuntu 20, 22, 24)
- MacOS 12.0+

### Hardware

- Sufficient memory to run vision and other models
- Reliable WiFi or other networking
- Sensors such as cameras, microphones, LIDAR units, IMUs
- Actuators and outputs such as speakers, visual displays, and movement platforms (legs, arms, hands)
- Hardware connected to the "central" computer via `Zenoh`, `CycloneDDS`, serial, usb, or custom APIs/libraries

### Software

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `Python` >= 3.10
- `uv` >= 0.6.2 as the Python package manager and virtual environment
- `portaudio` for audio input and output
- `ffmpeg` for video processing
- [Openmind API key](https://portal.openmind.org/)

#### UV (A Rust and Python package manager)

``` bash
# Mac
brew install uv 

# Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh 
```

#### PortAudio Library

For audio functionality, install `portaudio`:

```bash
# Mac
brew install portaudio

# Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev
```

#### ffmpeg

For video functionality, install FFmpeg:

```bash Mac
# Mac
brew install ffmpeg

# Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
``` 

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository

Run the following commands to clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash clone repo
git clone https://github.com/openmind/OM1.git
cd OM1
git submodule update --init
uv venv
```

2. Set the configuration variables

Locate the `config` folder and add your OpenMind API key to `/config/spot.json` (for example). If you do not already have one, you can obtain a free access key at https://portal.openmind.org/.  

```bash
# /config/spot.json
...
"api_key": "om1_live_..."
...
```

Note: Using the placeholder key **openmind-free** will generate errors.

Or, create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:

```bash
OM_API_KEY=om1_live_...
```

3. Run the Spot Agent

Run the following command to start the Spot Agent:

```bash
uv run src/run.py spot
```

On initial execution, this command will resolve and install project dependencies. Please allow a few minutes for this process to finish, before the system becomes active.

Note: This is just an example agent configuration. 
If you want to interact with the agent and see how it works, make sure ASR and TTS are configured in spot.json5.

ASR configuration (check in agent_inputs)
```bash
{
      "type": "GoogleASRInput"
}
```

TTS configuration (check in agent_actions)
```bash
{
      name: "speak",
      llm_label: "speak",
      connector: "elevenlabs_tts",
      config: 
      {
        voice_id: "i4CzbCVWoqvD0P1QJCUL",
        "silence_rate": 20,
      },
},
```

### WebSim to check input and output

Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see real time logs along with the input and output in the terminal. For easy debugging, add `--debug` to see additional logging information.

### Understanding the Log Data

The log data provide insight into how the `spot` agent makes sense of its environment and decides on its next actions.

  - First, it detects a person using vision.
  - Communicates with an external AI API for response generation.
  - The LLM(s) decide on a set of actions (dancing and speaking).
  - The simulated robot expresses emotions via a front-facing display.
  - Logs latency and processing times to monitor system performance.
  
```bash
Object Detector INPUT
// START
You see a person in front of you. You also see a laptop.
// END

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
command: move
    A movement to be performed by the agent.
    Effect: Allows the agent to move.
    Arguments: Allowed values: 'stand still', 'sit', 'dance', 'shake paw', 'walk', 'walk back', 'run', 'jump', 'wag tail'

command: speak
    Words to be spoken by the agent.
    Effect: Allows the agent to speak.
    Arguments: <class 'str'>

command: emotion
    A facial expression to be performed by the agent.
    Effect: Performs a given facial expression.
    Arguments: Allowed values: 'cry', 'smile', 'frown', 'think', 'joy'

What will you do? Command: 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openmind.org/api/core/openai/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:OpenAI LLM output: commands=[Command(type='move', value='wag tail'), Command(type='speak', value="Hi there! I see you and I'm excited!"), Command(type='emotion', value='joy')]
```

## More Examples

There are more pre-configured agents in the `/config` folder. They can be run with the following command:

For example, to run the `conversation` agent:

```bash
uv run src/run.py conversation
```

If you configure a custom agent, replace `<agent_name>` with your agent and run the below command:

```bash
uv run src/run.py <agent_name>
```
